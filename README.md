# Prism
### Up, Down, Top-down Reimagined
#### Releases available on [itch.io](https://somebud0180.itch.io/prism-maze)

A Maze + Platformer in one game. Made with Godot.
Taking place in 2 whole dimensions, the game is played through both 2D and 3D. You play as Prio, a prism-like that jumps and glides through, getting over any challenge. Beat all the levels and survive till the very end, with limited lives that can end your entire playthrough. Death means starting from the top, with no playthrough being exactly the same, the set of levels you play change with every game.

### The Two Dimensions
**3D:**
Experience 3D with an open space and more movesets, encounter levels where 2D meets 3D and beat the minigame to progress the game. Find more intricate platforming and an overall difficult but expansive play in this dimension.

**2D:**
Experience 2D with a classic look, reminiscent of the original game, with simpler movesets yet unique gameplay with gravity blocks and keys from the original game. Go through more unique and random mazes along with handcrafted platform and maze levels in this dimension.
